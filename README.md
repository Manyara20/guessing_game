# guessing_game
Let’s learn some Rust! For our first project, we’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: the guessing game.
Here’s how it works: Our program will generate a random integer between one and a hundred. It will then prompt us to enter a guess.
Upon entering our guess, it will tell us if we’re too low or too high. Once we guess correctly, it will congratulate us. Sounds good?
I added some new features from the one in the rustbook. Check it out and let me know.
